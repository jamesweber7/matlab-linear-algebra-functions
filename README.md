This is an honors project I did for my Applied Linear Algebra professor in Fall 2022.

Project: build MATLAB Functions for various linear algebra operations:
- matrix multiplication - matrix_multiply.m
- REF - REF.m
- RREF - RREF.m
- Solving systems using RREF - RREF_solve.m
- LU factorization - LU.m
- Solving systems using LU factorization - LU_solve.m
- QR factorization - QR.m
- Solving least squares problems using QR factorization - least_squares.m
- Gram-Schmidt algorithm - gram_schmidt.m

main.m demonstrates each function in use.
